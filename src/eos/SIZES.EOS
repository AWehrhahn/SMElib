      INTEGER IONSIZ
      PARAMETER (IONSIZ=6)
C
C Parameters used by the Equation of State (EOS) code.
C
      INTEGER ELEDIM,SPCHAR,SPLSIZ
      PARAMETER (ELEDIM=120,SPCHAR=8,SPLSIZ=650)
C
C ELEDIM - Used to dimension arrays (IATOM, INDSP, P) containing data
C  for each element that appears in the full species list (SPLIST).
C  Also used to dimension arrays (A, B, and AL) used in solving the
C  linearized equilibrium equations. ELEDIM must be less than or equal
C  to the total number of unique elements that appear in the species
C  list.
C
C ELESIZ - Used to dimension the arrays ELEMEN and AMASS, which contain
C  the name and atomic mass (in AMU) of each element (no molecules!).
C
C SPCHAR - Maximum number of characters required to store species names.
C  Note that SPCHAR must be large enough to allow two spaces after each
C  neutral molecular species (see MPARSE in eos.f).
C
C SPLSIZ - Used to dimension the local arrays XNPF, PFUNC, and POTION,
C  which contain "zeta", partition functions, and ionization potentials.
C  Should also be used (if possible) by the calling routine to dimension
C  the SPNAME and ION arrays. SPLSIZ must be large enough to handle the
C  base set of species used when computing the molecular equilibrium and
C  also any additional species that appear only in the line list.
